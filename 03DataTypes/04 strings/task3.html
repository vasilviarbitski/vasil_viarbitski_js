3. Write a JavaScript function that finds how many times a substring is contained in a given text (perform case insensitive search).

    **Example**: The target substring is **"in"**. The text is as follows: We are liv<b>in</b>g **in** an yellow submar<b>in</b>e. We don't have anyth<b>in</b>g else. **In**side the submar<b>in</b>e is very tight. So we are dr<b>in</b>k<b>in</b>g all the day. We will move out of it **in** 5 days.

    The result is: 9.
